## Note from Genki-jp0

This project is really old, and as the head developer of this project,
i have halted development of it.

I do not have the motivation to continue working on it anymore,
as i no longer see the need for this because i do not use classic theme.

This project was created for the WinClassic community back then, it was supposed to be fun.
But it was not, the source code reeks of stink that i wanted to reset the codebase and start off Explorer++ 1.4.x base builds.
Another reason of this project's termination is that ClassicServ is a rotten place, its why me,
and toiletflusher have left the ClassicServ discord server due to conflicts going on, and we do not want to go back.

Note from toiletflusher: I still check WinClassic sometimes but I am no longer in ClassicServ.  

Now, as this project is cancelled as of now, i have no need to worry about it.
SE 0.8.0 source code may be published, but beware that its a mess, and its not able to be compiled due to issues.
